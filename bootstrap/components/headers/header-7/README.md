**Navigation menu that opens down.**

This design features a collapsible, off-canvas navigation menu activated by a toggle button. When clicked, the button reveals a sidebar-style navigation panel with a dark dropdown menu for additional links. This layout is particularly useful for mobile-first websites, as it conserves space on the top bar while still offering a comprehensive navigation experience when expanded. Ideal for minimalistic, mobile-responsive designs.
